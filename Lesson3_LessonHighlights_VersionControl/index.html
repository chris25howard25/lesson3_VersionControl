            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is an extremely important aspect of the web development process and programming in general.  What version control does is it allows a developer to keep track of the mulitiple versions of a file or project over time in order to allow him or her to return to previous versions of that file.  This allows for projects to have fail safes and it ensures that if something goes wrong, a project will not be lost.  Another positive use of version control is that it allows users to identify who on the team modified which file at a certain time which aids in the problem solving process for large, complicated projects.  It is also an efficient way to see progress made in a project by keeping track of past versions.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system or VCS for short.  Git has become one of the more popular VCSs to arise in recent years.  It was developed in 2005 by Linux kernal developers in an answer to the controversial Bitkeeper.  When developing Git they focused on important factors like speed and non-linear development.  This non-linear development style has set Git apart from its counterparts due to the way it efficiently manages large projects.  It basically takes snapshots of how files look to maintain version control.  The most important part of Git is the git directory which is where all of the information for your project is stored, i.e. the metadata and database.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository is a place where data and files are stored.  Knowing that, a local repository is one that is located in the users possession.  In other words, a local repository is one that belongs to the users on their own machine.  These can be created either by the user from scratch or by copying or cloning a remote repository to the personal machine.  All other types of repositories that are not found locally are refferred to as remote repositories.  It is in these remote repositories that files and data from the local repositories are pushed to during the process.  </p>

            <p class="lead">GitHub was started in 2007 and was released in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett.  GitHub is a graphical interface used to implement Git into the development process, which is mainly used for coding projects.  GitHub projects and be manipulated using the standard git command line method and all of the Git commands work with it.  Besides the functionality of Git, GitHub adds additional benefits like collaboration tools, bug trackers, wikis, and much much more.  Additionally, GitHub assists students looking for development experience by giving them an education pack which provides numerous development tools, free of charge, to students.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">What is distributed version control and how is it different from version control?  Well they do share the same concept but distibuted version control is the way in which developers can share and work on projects at the same time without being on the same network and without interfereing with the work of another developer.  GitHub is one of the more popular tools for practicing distributed version control.  This practice has significantly revolutionized the way in which groups of software developers can collaborate on prjects effectively and efficiently.  And these types of systems are relatively new and will become more advanced in the coming years.  </p>
